Analysis templates
===
Standard lab protocols, recommendations, and a collection of scripts for basic data processing, analysis and visualization, to be modified as necessary for different projects

Organization
===
File structure (Mise en place)
___
This is something I'm actively optimizing and learning about, so my strategy might not exactly be a gold strategy, but it is extremely important to at least be thinking about!

Primary principles:

1. Keep a 'raw data' directory, where files are considered completely immutable for a given project or analysis. I waver between having a system-wide raw data directory that contains multiple project sub-directories, or a raw data directory within each project directory. But the point is that there should be a place where files belong that can be considered 'original' and that have READMEs associated with them to explain where these data came from. This directory could ideally be re-generated by unzipping a version archived somewhere such as zenodo.
2. Keep a 'intermediate data' directory. This can contain processed versions of your data, such as filtered sequencing reads or 'cleaned' metadata files. Ideally, these files could be generated from the 'raw' files using scripts, which are contained in a separate:
3. 'Scripts' directory. This directory is ideally a project-specific Git repository that can track changes and be collaborated on through GitHub, where an archived version can be created upon manuscript submission. These scripts should ideally be cross-platform compatible, use relative filepaths, and take command line arguments, such that someone can simply download the raw data, clone this repository, specify local settings and the location of an output directory, and completely re-generate the results of your study by running your scripts as specified in a README.
